      Your task is to migrate a Java file from using the Amazon S3 API to the Azure Storage Blob API while maintaining the same functionality. Below is a reference to the relevant Azure Storage Blob APIs for your convenience. You can tell whether it's an aws or Azure API from the package name.
      Try replace all references to S3 APIs with equivalent Azure Storage Blob APIs, using the provided API descriptions as guidance.
      Ensure the resulting code is clean, efficient, and preserves the original functionality.
      Some of the methods are of the same name under different class, please pay attention to the type before using.
      Below are the APIs provided for your reference, don't forget to import the package whenever you are adding a new class reference in code edit:

      Interface: CreateBucketRequest.Builder
        Package: software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.model
        Methods:
          - CreateBucketRequest.Builder bucketâ€‹(String bucket)
            Description: The name of the bucket to create.
            Parameters:
              - bucket - The name of the bucket to create.
            Returns:
              - Returns a reference to this object so that method calls can be chained together.

      Interface: CreateBucketResponse.Builder
        Package: software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.model
        Methods: No useful methods.

      Class: BlobContainerClient
        Description: Client to a container. It may only be instantiated through a BlobContainerClientBuilder or via the method getBlobContainerClient(String containerName). This class does not hold any state about a particular container but is instead a convenient way of sending off appropriate requests to the resource on the service. It may also be used to construct URLs to blobs. This client contains operations on a container. Operations on a blob are available on BlobClient through getBlobClient(String blobName), and operations on the service are available on BlobServiceClient.
        Package: com.azure.storage.blob
        Methods:
          - void create()
            Description: Creates a new container within a storage account. If a container with the same name already exists, the operation fails.
            Parameters: N/A
            Returns: N/A
          - boolean createIfNotExists()
            Description: Creates a new container within a storage account if it does not exist.
            Parameters: N/A
            Returns: true if container is successfully created, false if container already exists.
