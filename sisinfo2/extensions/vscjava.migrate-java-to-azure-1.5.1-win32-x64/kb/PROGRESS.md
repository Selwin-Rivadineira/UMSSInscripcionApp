# Java Modernization Map Project Deliverables Checklist

This document tracks the progress of all deliverables for the Java Modernization Map project. Each item represents a migration specification (X→Y pair) that can be generated using the `MODERNIZATION-SPECIFICATION-TEMPLATE.md` template.

## Instructions to Generate the Specification

To generate specification files for migration pairs, use a prompt like the following:

Example:
```
// context: PROGRESS.md
Generate the specification for `[1] Spring Cloud Config [6] → Azure App Configuration`
```

**MUST Follow These Instructions:**

1. ✅ Reference the `MODERNIZATION-SPECIFICATION-TEMPLATE.md` file as the template to follow
2. ✅ No other files should be referenced during generation except for the template
   ❌ * DO NOT reference other existing specification files ❌
3. ✅ Replace placeholders in the template with actual technology names and details
4. ✅ Ensure the generated specification follows the exact structure and format of the template
5. ✅ After the generation, mark the corresponding item as completed by checking the checkbox `- [x] ` of the list item

## Prevalence Score Legend

The numbers in square brackets [1-10] after each source technology (X) indicate how commonly this technology is encountered in systems that need modernization:

- [1]: Extremely rare - Almost never encountered in systems needing migration
- [2]: Very rare - Seldom encountered in systems needing migration
- [3]: Rare - Found in specialized legacy systems
- [4]: Uncommon - Occasionally found in legacy systems
- [5]: Somewhat common - Appears in a notable subset of modernization projects
- [6]: Moderately common - Regularly appears in modernization projects
- [7]: Common - Frequently found in systems needing modernization
- [8]: Very common - Expected in most legacy Java systems
- [9]: Highly common - Present in the vast majority of legacy Java systems
- [10]: Extremely common - Nearly ubiquitous in legacy Java systems

These scores help prioritize migration paths based on how likely you are to encounter the source technology in real-world modernization scenarios.

### Prevalence Score Timeline Considerations (Last Updated: June 2025)

The prevalence scores reflect the estimated frequency of encountering these technologies in modernization projects **as of June 2025**. These scores take into account:

1. **Technology Lifecycle Stage**: Where technologies fall in their adoption, maturity, and obsolescence curve.
   - Example: JDK 7 is rated [5] (somewhat common) as most organizations have moved to JDK 8+ by 2025.
   - Example: Quarkus is rated [6] (moderately common) reflecting its increased adoption since 2019.

2. **Historical Dominance Period**: When a technology was at its peak adoption.
   - Example: Java EE and Spring Web Applications are both rated [9] (highly common) reflecting that both
     represent major waves of enterprise Java development, with Java EE dominating earlier (pre-2015)
     and Spring becoming more prevalent after that.

3. **Modernization Lag Period**: The typical time between a technology becoming "legacy" and actively being targeted for modernization (typically 5-10 years).

4. **Enterprise Adoption Patterns**: Differences between early adopter organizations and more conservative enterprises.

As time passes, these scores will need to be reassessed as technologies continue to evolve and adoption patterns change.

## Modernization Scenarios

NOTE: **the file path in each scenario is relative to the path of this `PROGRESS.md` file.**
