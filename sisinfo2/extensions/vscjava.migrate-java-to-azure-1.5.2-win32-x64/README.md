# Key capabilities

## Application Assessment and Planning – Analyze code, configuration, and dependencies. 
Copilot analyzes your project's current state and generates modernization plans. The tool identifies dependencies, outdated libraries, and potential migration issues. It provides actionable strategies to remediate problems.

## Code Transformations – Suggest and apply code remediation for upgrade and migration scenarios.

Copilot upgrades Java versions and framework.

To accelerate code changes for [common modernization issues](https://aka.ms/migrate-github-copilot-app-modernization-for-java-predefined-formula), you may apply **predefined tasks** that encode expert knowledge for common Azure migration scenarios including secret management, message queue integration, identity services and more.

![Apply Formula](https://aka.ms/appmod-java-migration-extension-apply-formula-image)

To imitate past changes on other applications, you may pick some git commits and/or the working tree diff, save them as a **custom task**, then apply it just like a predefined task.

## Modernize and secure – ensure successful build, validate unit tests and address CVEs

Modernization includes comprehensive build validation. Copilot automatically resolves build issues that arise during transformation. It performs test validations to ensure error-free changes. Production pipeline integrity is maintained throughout the modernization process.
Security vulnerability management is integrated into the modernization process. The system scans for CVEs after upgrades. It automatically applies security fixes in Agent Mode. You can review all security-related changes. This improves your security posture while maintaining compliance requirements.

## Containerization and Deployment – Generate assets for app containerization and deployment 
Copilot creates Infrastructure as Code files for Azure deployment. It addresses deployment errors automatically. CI/CD pipelines are set up for continuous integration. This completes the modernization workflow from analysis to production.
